"""Find a contractor's Google Maps listing via Serper's Places search.

A listing carries the phone number and website the business chose to publish,
plus its Google rating and review count — the public signs of how busy it is.
Search results are only trusted when they are provably the same business: the
listing's street address must match the US DOT business address, or failing that,
its name must match and it must sit in the same ZIP code. Anything less is
left blank, because calling the wrong business is worse than calling none.

An address alone isn't proof: an office building or a shopping strip holds
many businesses, and Google may return a neighbour. So an address match also
needs the listing's name to share a word with the business's (or its
official's) name, or its phone to be one the registry lists for it.
