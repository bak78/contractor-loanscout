"""Keep the results to real small-business leads.

Rows that aren't leads move out of the results into a sibling file,
<results>_left_out.csv, with the reason in its first column, so they can
still be reviewed (and copied back if a rule was wrong about one):

- disqualified companies (nonprofits, lenders, public companies, directory
  sites), as each one is found;
- chains and corporate groups, at the end of each run: a website or email
  domain shared by several different companies in the results means they
  belong to one larger organization (a health system's practices, a
  building-products group's subsidiaries). Each files separately — with the
  NPI registry or US DOT — so nothing else reveals it.

Domains that many unrelated businesses share without being one company never
count: email providers (gmail, comcast, cox…), website builders (wixsite…),
directories, and the franchise brands listed in the settings, whose offices
are independently owned small businesses.
