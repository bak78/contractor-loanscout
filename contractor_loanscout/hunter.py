"""Find a company officer's email with Hunter.io's Email Finder.

The email on a US DOT filing is often whoever filled in the form, not the
officer it names. The filing gives the officer's name, and its email or the
Google listing gives the company's domain: exactly what Email Finder takes. It
returns the most likely address and whether Hunter could verify the mailbox.
Only verified addresses are kept. "accept_all" (the mail server says yes to
every address, so nothing can be confirmed) and "unknown" are left out — a
guessed address is worse than none.
