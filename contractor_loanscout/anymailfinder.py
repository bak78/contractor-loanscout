"""Find a person's email with Anymailfinder's Find Person Email API.

Given a first name, a last name and a company domain, Anymailfinder returns
the person's address and its status: valid (verified), risky (the mail server
accepts every address, so nothing can be confirmed), not_found or blacklisted.
Only valid addresses are kept.

It charges one credit per valid email found; risky, blacklisted and not-found
results are free, and so is repeating a search within 30 days.
